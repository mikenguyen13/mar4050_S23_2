I have done most of the work for this group all semester long which is unfair. I have decided to let this last assignment be one that I let other people take the reign on so they can get points for participating but nobody stepped to it so therefore nothing is going to be turned it. This last assignment is too much for one person to do and I refuse to do it all myself for the benefit of everybody else because I did that all semester long. The one project I step back from is the one project that doesn't get done. This has been the worst group I've had in a long time. Nobody wanted to do anything which often left me to do it all by myself. I got help from a few members every once in awhile but I did more than 50% of the work all semester.
