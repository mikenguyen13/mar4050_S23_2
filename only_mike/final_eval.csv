Shelby put together a lot of work for the recommendations and then I followed by collecting and formatting it while we had to beg everyone else for help. Shelby put together all of the slides for the presentation and I did 95% of the graphs and had to fix a bunch of other data. For the final report, Ashley did an amazing job putting together the slides and information except data. I (once again, after begging anyone else to help me with the data again) had to do pretty much all of it. Shelby did most of the edits for the final report and is the only person who was even a little helpful with the data. Everyone else disregarded the format and examples I had and did the three RQs I asked for help with totally wrong so I had to fix everything. The entire time, the other 3 group members barely responded and offered little help. I'm extremely disappointed."
